## _conf4j_ - Type-safe Configuration Library for Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SabreOSS/conf4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SabreOSS/conf4j)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.sabre.oss.conf4j/conf4j-api/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.sabre.oss.conf4j/conf4j-api)

__conf4j__ is a library which allows accessing configuration data in object-oriented, type-safe manner.

In _conf4j_ configuration is represented as an interface or abstract class optionally annotated with _conf4j_ annotations.

```java
@Key("connection")
public interface ConnectionConfiguration {
   String getUrl();

   String getUser();

   String getPassword();

   @DefaultValue("60")
   int getConnectionTimeout();

   @DefaultValue("30")
   int getReadTimeout();
}
```

Then a configuration instance is created and bound to the _value source_ by the _configuration factory_.

```java
ConfigurationSource source = new PropertiesConfigurationSource("configuration.properties");
ConfigurationFactory factory = new JdkProxyStaticConfigurationFactory();
ConnectionConfiguration configuration = factory.createConfiguration(ConnectionConfiguration.class, source);
```

Once the configuration instance is created you can access the configuration values via getters:

```java
String url =  configuration.getUrl();
int connectionTimeout = configuration.getConnectionTimeout();
```

Example _configuration.properties_ is as follows:

```properties
connection.url=https://github.com/SabreOss/conf4j
connection.user=john
connection.password=secret
connection.connectionTimeout=45
```

For more information how to use _conf4j_ please read [Conf4j User's Guide](USERS-GUIDE.md)
and check [conf4j-examples](conf4j-examples) directory.

## Contributing

We accept pull request via _GitHub_. Here are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for us:

* No tabs. Please use spaces for indentation.
* Respect the code style.
* Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports.
  If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
* Provide _JUnit_ tests for your changes and make sure they don't break anything by running
  `mvn clean verify`.
