/**
 * Extract configuration model from classes/interfaces based on convention. It is handy when it is not desirable
 * to pollute configuration classes with any <i>conf4j</i> specific api.
 * <p>
 * Convention doesn't allow specifying some metadata, for example it is not possible to specify more than one
 * <i>configuration key</i>, <i>fallback, global keys</i> nor <i>default values</i>.
 * In such cases it is possible to use <i>conf4j</i> annotations as a fallback.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Following conventions is used while extracting configuration data:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * A method associated with a configuration property must be public, abstract, returns non {@code void},
 * has no parameters and start with {@code get} (or {@code is} when methods return type is {@code boolean}).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Property name is used as configuration key for value properties or prefix for sub-configuration
 * and sub-configuration list properties.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * A type is recognized as the configuration type if it is abstract type and all its abstract methods
 * are valid configuration methods as specified above.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * A type is recognized as abstract configuration if it is a configuration type and its simple class name
 * starts with <i>Abstract</i> prefix.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Default values for value properties which returns primitive types (like {@code short}, {@code int})
 * are always defined and are same as default values for class fields of primitive types (usually {@code 0}).
 * For all other types, default value is not specified.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
