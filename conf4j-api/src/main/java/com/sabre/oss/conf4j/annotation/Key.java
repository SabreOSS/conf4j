/**
 * Specifies a configuration key for a configuration property in a configuration class.
 * For hierarchical configurations the final property key is a concatenation of keys from all configuration
 * levels and above, starting with the root configuration.
 * <p>
 * {@code @Key} annotation is applied to the configuration type or the property method. When it is applied in the type
 * or on the property which returns sub-configurations or a list of sub-configurations, it specifies a key prefix
 * which is appended to the children properties. When {@code @Key} is applied to the value property
 * (where the type is not another configuration or list of configurations), it specifies the final component of the key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code @Key} can specify multiple keys (or prefixes). Each key is applied in the sequence
 * until the configuration value associated with the resulting key is found. When {@code value} is not specified,
 * the property name (when the annotation is applied on the getter) or uncapitalized short class name is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Note</i>: Specifying {@code @Key} (without any keys) on the value property (which type is not another
 * configuration nor list of configurations) is optional in default <i>non-strict</i> configuration model provider.
 * If <i>strict</i> provider is used, every value configuration property must be annotated.
 * </p>
 * <b>Example usage:</b>
 * <pre>
 * // defines a 'connection' prefix which is applied for all properties defined by the configuration type
 * &#064;Key("connection")
 * public interface ConnectionConfiguration {
 *    // When key doesn't specify value explicitly, property name is used.
 *    // Full key associated with the property is 'connection.url',
 *    // 'connection' prefix is from the &#064;Key annotation type.
 *    &#064;Key
 *    String getUrl();
 *
 *    // Key name is explicitly specified, the full key is 'connection.timeout'.
 *    &#064;Key("timeout")
 *    int getConnectionTimeout();
 *
 *    // Multiple keys are specified, the key set of the property is 'connection.defaultTimeout'
 *    // and 'connection.standardTimeout'.
 *    &#064;Key({"defaultTimeout", "standardTimeout"})
 *    int getDefaultTimeout();
 * }
 * </pre>
