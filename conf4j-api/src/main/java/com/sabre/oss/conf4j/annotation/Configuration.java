/**
 * This is a markup annotation which indicates an interface or an abstract class is a configuration.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note:</i> Using this annotation is optional. It is required only when the type (or any of the type's method)
 * is not annotated with any annotation from the {@link com.sabre.oss.conf4j.annotation} package.
 * Otherwise the framework recognizes the type as a configuration.
 * <p>
 * Configuration consists of a set of properties. A property can be any type; however, there must be an appropriate
 * {@link TypeConverter} capable of converting type from string. The framework out-of-the-box handles properties
 * of configuration type or a list of configuration types (such configurations are called sub-configurations).
 * Cycles (direct nor indirect) between configurations are not supported.
 * <p>
 * Each configuration property must follow JavaBeans naming conventions,
 * and must be {@code public} and {@code abstract} (which is always true for configurations based on the interface)
 * and optionally annotated with @{@link Key}.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note:</i> {@code @Key} may be required for value configuration property by <i>strict</i>
 * configuration model providers (when default <i>non-strict</i> provider is used).
 * <p>
 * <b>Example configurations:</b>
 * <pre>
 * // Using &#064;Configuration annotation is optional, because the type is annotated
 * // with other conf4j annotations; however, it may be useful for documentation purposes.
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;Key("connection")
 * public interface ConnectionConfiguration {
 *    // &#064;Key is optional here as long as the default, non-strict configuration model provider is used.
 *    &#064;Key
 *    String getUrl();
 *
 *    TimeoutConfiguration getTimeout();
 * }
 * &#064;Configuration
 * public interface TimeoutConfiguration {
 *    &#064;Key("connect")
 *    int getConnectTimeout();
 *
 *    &#064;Key("read")
 *    int getReadTimeout();
 * }
 * </pre>
