/**
 * Specifies the default value for a value property in a configuration class. A value property is defined
 * as a standard Java type or any other type that is not a sub-configuration or a list of sub-configurations.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note:</i> Default value is encoded as a string. It is converted to the value of the property type, which
 * depends on the {@link TypeConverter}. Converters are configurable and it is the developer's responsibility
 * to ensure the converter configuration matches the format of the default value.
 * <p> <b>Example usage:</b>
 * <pre>
 * public interface ConnectionConfiguration {
 *    &#064;Key("name")
 *    &#064;Default("http://www.sabre.com")
 *    String getUrl();
 *
